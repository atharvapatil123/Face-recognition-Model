# Face-recognition-Model
This Model uses the <b><i>Haar feature-based cascade classifiers</i></b> to recognize faces. 
This is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.

To know more about this technique, head over to <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html">this</a> documentation

After capturing one's face and getting name of the person as input, it stores it to a dataset.
Further, it uses KNN Algorithm to find the face to which the name fits the best!
